# MATCH-MAKING-
A MATCH-MAKING GAME in PYTHON 

So I Have tried to create a small game
"MATCHMAKING GAME"

Overview of this Project -
->So in this, we have 24 cards of which we have 12 unique cards and other cards are their copy ...

->So whenever we click anyone there will be a certain figure appeared there and when you find another pair of this one then you have to click any of these and all the random...

->so we have to make a pair of these if you get the correct pair the cards will remain the same...
